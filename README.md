# Swift-WeatherApp
A Simple Weather app using DarkSKy Api and the users current location

## IMPORTANT

- At this moment it does not handle running this app on a simulator since we use geolocation and device back camera.

## Highlight 

- Gives the current temperature (in celcius) based on the users current location.
- Displays the _icons_ related to the current temperature (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Displays the atmospheric humidty as well as the chance of precipitation.
- Background is a AVPreviewLayer displaying a live feed of the rear camera as the view background.
